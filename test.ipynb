    "Investigating galactic mean-field dynamos stems from a quest to comprehend the emergence and progression of magnetic fields within galaxies. Studying this dynamo is significant because it offers a framework to understand how galactic motions and turbulence are converted into magnetic fields. This knowledge sheds light on star formation, cosmic ray containment within the galaxy, and potentially even galactic evolution. Our research aims to elucidate the effects of vertical outflows in these systems, given their significant influence on gas and magnetic field distributions within galaxies. These outflows play a pivotal role in determining star formation rates and facilitating matter-energy transport processes.   In this study, our goal was to progressively increase $V_z$ over time, thereby leading to the quenching of the dynamo. In our study, we address these phenomena by solving the mean field induction equation and analyzing the evolution of the magnetic field, particularly focusing on the quenching of the dynamo when considering the influence of the vertical outflow velocity, denoted by $ \\overline{V_z} $. we employ finite difference methods to accurately compute spatial derivatives. Furthermore, for the temporal evolution of the system, we rely on the robust and widely-used Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method. Our results underscore the profound impact of the choice of the $ V_z $ function on the behavior of the dynamo. We observe that certain functions lead to a gradual decay of the magnetic field over time, while others induce growth.To achieve magnetic field saturation or quenching, the $V_z$ function needs to exhibit characteristics that fall between these two extremes. This observation highlights the sensitivity of the dynamo process to the specific form of the $ V_z $ function employed.\n",

    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    " Vast galactic magnetic fields are generated by the dynamo effect, similar to Earth's, where moving charged particles create a magnetic field. The strength and structure of these galactic fields are thought to be vital for star formation, shaping galactic arms, and even trapping cosmic rays. Galactic mean field theory offers a theoretical framework for understanding the large-scale magnetic fields permeating galaxies. This simplification allows for tractable analysis of how these bulk motions might amplify a weak seed magnetic field via the dynamo effect, similar to Earth's magnetic field generation. While acknowledging limitations in capturing the full complexity of galactic turbulence and small-scale structures, mean field theory provides a valuable foundation for studying the generation and overall properties of large-scale galactic magnetic fields. \n",

    " Galactic dynamo theory proposes a mechanism for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields observed in spiral galaxies like the Milky Way. It draws inspiration from the established dynamo effect, where the motion of electrically conducting fluids interacts with existing magnetic fields to create and amplify them. In the galactic context, this theory posits that the differential rotation and turbulence of the interstellar medium, a vast expanse of ionized gas and dust, act as the driving forces. Differential rotation refers to the varying rotational speeds of different regions within the galactic disk, while turbulence creates a chaotic flow pattern. These combined motions act to stretch, twist, and fold any weak seed magnetic field present. This process, through a series of complex magnetohydrodynamic interactions, can lead to the amplification of the magnetic field over time, ultimately generating the large-scale field observed. Despite its explanatory power, galactic dynamo theory remains an active area of research.\n",

    "When the vertical outflow velocity, denoted by $ \\overline{V_z} $, is set to zero, the magnetic field undergoes the expected expected growth over time. This outcome aligns with theoretical expectations, as without any vertical motion to sustain it, the magnetic field naturally grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, interesting dynamics emerge when $ \\overline{V_z} $ is increased to 1.045, and when using the logarithmic function mentioned earlier. In these cases, saturation/or steady state of the magnetic field is observed after a certain period. This saturation indicates a balance between the amplification and dissipation of the magnetic field, resulting in a stable, non-changing magnetic field state.\n",

    "when employing a linear function of time, although it allows for the control of magnetic field decay,  the magnetic field exhibits growth as time progresses. This growth suggests that the linear function of time contributes to the amplification of the magnetic field over time.\n",

    "Furthermore, by adjusting the value of $ \\overline{V_z} $ to be below 1.045, the magnetic field eventually grows, albeit at a slower rate due to the smaller value of the growth constant. Conversely, when $ \\overline{V_z} $ exceeds 1.045, the magnetic field undergoes  decay over time. This observation underscores the critical role of the vertical outflow velocity in determining the long-term behavior of the magnetic field evolution within the galactic mean-field dynamo framework.\n",

    "In our analysis, we systematically studied the changes in the magnetic field as we varied the parameter $D$. We noticed a trend where increasing the value of $D$ led to a corresponding increase in the average value of $\\overline{V_z}$ required to achieve a stable or saturated state.\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explored the influence of different vertical outflow functions $V_z$ on the magnetic field evolution in galactic mean field dynamo theory. We analyzed how these functions impact the long-term behavior of the dynamo process, specifically focusing on magnetic field saturation.\n",
    "Our results demonstrate that the choice of the $V_z$ function has a significant effect on the dynamo.Certain functions lead to a decay of the magnetic field over time, while others induce growth. To achieve magnetic field saturation or quenching, the $V_z$ function needs to exhibit characteristics that fall between these two extremes.\n",
    "In conclusion, our study highlights the intricate relationship between the vertical outflow velocity $ \\overline{V_z} $ and the evolution of the magnetic field within the galactic mean-field dynamo framework. When $ \\overline{V_z} $ is set to zero, the magnetic field follows the expected growth pattern over time, in line with theoretical predictions. However, intriguing dynamics emerge as $ \\overline{V_z} $ is increased to 1.045, particularly when using the logarithmic function. In these instances, the magnetic field reaches saturation/staedy state after a certain period, indicating a delicate balance between amplification and dissipation processes. Interestingly, employing a linear function of time results in  amplification of the magnetic field over time.\n",
    "Moreover, adjusting $ \\overline{V_z} $ below 1.045 leads to a growth of the magnetic field, albeit at a slower rate due to the smaller growth constant. Conversely, when $ \\overline{V_z} $ exceeds 1.045, the magnetic field undergoes  decay over time. These observations underscore the pivotal role of the vertical outflow velocity in shaping the long-term behavior of the magnetic field evolution in galactic mean-field dynamo systems.Also our investigation involved a systematic analysis of the magnetic field's evolution under diverse values of  $D$.  Our systematic investigation into the magnetic field's evolution across varying $D$ values revealed a consistent pattern: as the parameter $D$ increased, there was a proportional rise in the average value of $\\overline{V_z}$ necessary to attain a stable or saturated state. This finding underscores the significant influence of $D$ on the dynamics of the magnetic field, providing valuable insights for future studies in this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings possess broader implications that transcend the scope of the systems under study, resonating deeply with our understanding of real-world galactic phenomena. Historically, velocity outflow terms have often been overlooked in efforts to streamline the complexity of system dynamics. Nevertheless, our research emphasizes the crucial importance of integrating these terms into our models, especially considering their profound influence on the evolution of magnetic fields. Moreover, we shed light on their intricate connection to star formation rates and the transportation of matter within and beyond the system. By acknowledging and incorporating these factors, we advance our comprehension of galactic dynamics, paving the way for more accurate and insightful models of cosmic processes.\n",
